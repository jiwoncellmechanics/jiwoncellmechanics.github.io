Ceiling culture chip reveals dynamic lipid droplet transport during adipocyte dedifferentiation via actin remodeling

Live-cell imaging adipocytes
Adipocytes float

Adipocytes look weird (are they really cells?)


Traditionally ceiling culture chip

Waste of media --> even for the standard T25 flask, it takes 50 + mL to compleletly fill the flask.
Do not fit within working distance of high magnification objectives

Many alternative papers --> just add references

Microfluidics? but they just flow away in 1-layered channel

So I made "ceiling culture chip"
Cells and flow trapped near the ceiling



그래서 live cell imaging 왜?
Prof. Jae Myoung Suh, expert on adipocyte metabolism
He was interested in the mechanisms of lipid droplet secretion (lipid droplet transportation) during adipocyte dedifferentiation
Which was challenging with existing technologies
So he wanted to collaborate with our lab - so that image that moment with non traditional way.. which is microfludics!


to investigate
