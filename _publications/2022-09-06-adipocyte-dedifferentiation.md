It was once believed that fat cells (adipocytes) are *terminally* differentiated.
The term terminal implies that the form and function of the cells are fixed forever and they cannot revered into status with greater potentials (stemness).

However, recent studies revealed that adipocytes can be reversed into stem cells under certain conditions.

Dedifferentiated adipocytes (DFATs) can be differentiated into bone cells, cartilage cells, muscle cells, and blood vessel cells: **_Someday, you can replace broken part of your body with your excessive fat!_**

But nobody has witnessed the transition from fat cell to stem cell, because adipocytes float.

Adipocytes look weird (are they really cells?)


Traditionally ceiling culture chip

Waste of media --> even for the standard T25 flask, it takes 50 + mL to compleletly fill the flask.
Do not fit within working distance of high magnification objectives

Many alternative papers --> just add references

Microfluidics? but they just flow away in 1-layered channel

So I made "ceiling culture chip"
Cells and flow trapped near the ceiling
