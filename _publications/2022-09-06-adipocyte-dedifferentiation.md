It was once believed that fat cells (adipocytes) are *terminally* differentiated.
The term *terminal* implies that the form and function of the cells are fixed forever and they cannot be reversed into status with greater potentials (stemness).

However, recent studies revealed that adipocytes can be reversed into stem cells under certain conditions. Dedifferentiated adipocytes (DFATs) can be differentiated into bone cells, cartilage cells, muscle cells, and blood vessel cells: **_Someday, you can replace broken part of your body with your excessive fat!_**

But nobody has witnessed how a fat cell spit out its fat pocket and become a stem cell, mainly because of following two reasons:

(1) Once a adipocyte discharge the lipid droplet, it just looks like fibroblasts. You can't tell if it's a dedifferentiated adipocytes or fibroblast.
Our team resolved this issue using *Adipoq-Cre; mT/mG* system. Long story short, a cell that has a history of being an adipocytes expresses **<span style="color:green;">green</span>** signal while all the other cells are **<span style="color:red;">red.</span>**

(2) Adipocytes have low specific gravity, which causes them to float in cell culture media. On the top of that,

Microfluidics? but they just flow away in 1-layered channel
