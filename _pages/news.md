## Awarded the Hibbitt Postdoctoral Fellowship (2023 - present)

I was awarded the **Hibbitt Postdoctoral Fellowship** at **Brown University**. Awardees are be expected to carry out independent and collaborative research with engineering faculty members. They are also expected to teach one course per year in the School, to help connect innovations in the research environment to concepts taught in courses, and to ensure they develop strong teaching skills prior to launching their faculty careers.
